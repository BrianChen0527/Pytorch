<h2>
1: GAN anime Face Generator
</h2>
This is probably the coolest project out of all the other ones. It's amazing what generative adversarial networks can create!<br>
Created a deep learning face generator that generates fictional anime character faces using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in Pytorch. 
The generator model was built using a transposed-convolutional neural network and the discriminator model was built using a deep convolutional neural network.
Together they were trained with Kaggle's anime face dataset.<br><br>
Here are the results after many many hours of training:

Here's a video showing some of the results in the early stages of training:
